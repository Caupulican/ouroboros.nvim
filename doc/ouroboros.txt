INTRODUCTION                                                 *ouroboros-intro*             

ouroboros provides a means of quickly switching from a header file to the
corresponding implementation file and vice versa. You can use the command
`:Ouroboros` to switch the file in the active buffer.

USAGE                                                        *ouroboros-usage*

Switching between files is as easy as calling:
>
	:Ouroboros
>

I highly suggest binding this to allow quick switching at will:
>
	" Example keybinding:
	noremap <leader>sw :Ouroboros<CR>
>

Note

The `Ouroboros` command only works when called from a file ending in one of
the following: `.cpp`,`.hpp`, `.h`, `.c`. Furthermore, ouroboros will respect
your `.gitignore` file if one is present and ignore any possible matches that
are also present in the `.gitignore` file.

DEBUGGING                                                    *ouroboros-debug*

You can set 'g:ouroboros_debug' to true to enable additional logging that will
detail what the internals of ouroboros are doing while being run. This can 
help diagnose results that aren't what you expect.
